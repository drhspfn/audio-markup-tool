# Audio Markup Tool

## Overview

A React-based web application for audio file annotation. This tool enables users to load audio files from a selected directory, visualize waveforms, and add annotation regions. Users can manipulate (move/delete) these regions and export annotations in both JSON and CSV formats.

## Features

- üéµ Audio file navigation and waveform visualization
- ‚úèÔ∏è Region-based annotation system
- üìÅ Local directory selection and file browsing
- üìä Export annotations to JSON or CSV
- üìà Real-time statistics dashboard
- ‚å®Ô∏è Convenient keyboard shortcuts

## Export Formats

### JSON Example
```json
[
  {
    "name": "/1.mp3",
    "regions": [
      [
        0,
        30.1
      ],
      [
        45.4,
        80
      ]
    ]
  }
]
```

### CSV Format Example
```csv
path,start_1,end_1,start_2,end_2,start_3,end_3
1.mp3,0,5,1,4,,
10.mp3,0,5,,,,
```

The CSV export format dynamically adjusts its columns based on the maximum number of labels present across all files. For example:
- If a file has one label: Uses columns `start_1` and `end_1`
- If a file has two labels: Uses columns up to `start_2` and `end_2`
- If a file has three labels: Uses columns up to `start_3` and `end_3`

The number of columns will always be twice the maximum number of labels found in any file (one column for start and one for end of each label).
